###Snok
######A snake game

Snok is a snake game I've been trying to make for few months now. I never seem to have the time or want to finish this game, but I've promised it to some guy on the internet, so I guess I'll have to do it sooner or later.

To build and run "*simply*" type the following commands in the root of this repository:

```
cabal install --only-dependencies
cabal configure
cabal build
cabal run
```

You'll need:

 - cabal
 - haskell

Enjoy, if you can.
